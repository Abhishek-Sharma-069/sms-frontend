Student Management System - Angular Frontend
1. Project Title
Student Management System - Angular Frontend (SPA)
2. Project Overview
This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with Angular. It demonstrates industry-ready
frontend development practices such as component-based architecture, reusable services, routing,
and deployment readiness. The backend is excluded here - focus is only on the Angular side.
3. Objectives
- Build a scalable Angular SPA
- Implement CRUD operations via Angular services (API integration assumed)
- Apply layered, component-based architecture and best practices
- Prepare learners for real-world corporate frontend projects
4. Technology Stack
- Frontend: Angular 16+, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- Tools: VS Code, Git, Postman (for API testing)
5. Frontend Architecture
- Component-based architecture
- Services for API communication
- Routing for navigation
- Models for type safety
6. Angular Folder Structure
src/app
-- components
-- services
-- models
-- app-routing.module.ts
-- app.module.ts
7. Angular Features
- Student List Component - Display all students
- Add/Edit Student Forms - Reactive Forms with validation
